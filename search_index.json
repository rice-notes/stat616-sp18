Often\nwe perform comparisons between two distribution's parameters, such as compare\nmeans.  The general flow of hypothesis testing involves:\n\nMaking initial assumption\nCollecting data\nBased on the data, or some statistic generated from the data, deciding\nwhether or not to reject the initial assumption.\n\nExample: Is normal body temperature really 98.6 degrees F?\nConsider the population of many, many adults. A researcher hypothesized that\nthe average adult body temperature is lower than the often-advertised 98.6\ndegrees F. That is, the researcher wants an answer to the question: \"Is the\naverage adult body temperature 98.6 degrees? Or is it lower?\" To answer his\nresearch question, the researcher starts by assuming that the average adult\nbody temperature was 98.6 degrees F.\nThen, the researcher went out and tried to find evidence that refutes his\ninitial assumption. In doing so, he selects a random sample of 130 adults. The\naverage body temperature of the 130 sampled adults is 98.25 degrees.\nThen, the researcher uses the data he collected to make a decision about his\ninitial assumption. Namely, the researcher would like to know that given \nthe average body temperature is 98.6, is a sample measurement of 98.25 likely \nor unlikely?\nIf it is likely, then the researcher does not reject his initial assumption\nthat the average adult body temperature is 98.6 degrees. There is not enough\nevidence to do otherwise.\nIf it is unlikely, then:  \n\neither the researcher's initial assumption is correct and he experienced a very unusual event\nor the researcher's initial assumption is incorrect.\n\nGlossary\n\nType I Error: the incorrect rejection of a true null hypothesis\nType II Error: incorrectly failing to reject a false null hypothesis\np-value: probability of a Type I error given our data\n\n"},"background/regression-analysis.html":{"url":"background/regression-analysis.html","title":"Regression Analysis","keywords":"","body":"Regression Analysis\nA set of statistical processes for estimating relationships among variables.\nIn particular, regression analysis is used when the focus is on the\nrelationship between a dependent variable (response) and one or more indpendent\nvariables (predictors).
